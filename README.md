# file_association
There is a demo version of the console application named "FileAssociation" which can add supported types to the application, get which types does the application (service) support, get which applications (services) support the specific type and store the data despite all possible exceptions. It was developed by using Qt QDBus technologies and JSON (to store the data while the application is turned of).

Qt 6.2.4 (qt6), g++ compiler, cmake were used.

There are no other requirements.
